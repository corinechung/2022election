      <description>This week, I explored the effect of political advertisements (from 2006 to 2018) on the Democrat voteshare at the Congressional district level. The specific relationship I will explore is the effect that Democratic advertisement share (the percentage of ads run in the district that were for the Democratic candidate) has on Democratic voteshare.
I ran a simple linear regression model between Democratic voteshare and Democratic ad share. The table below shows each districtâ€™s linear regression model and its r-squared value and coefficient for Democratic ad share.</description>

      <description>Shocks As discussed in class and section, election shocks are events that couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been predicted but could significantly affect election outcomes. Examples of shocks from this year include the overturning of Roe v. Wade via the Dobbs decision and the war in Ukraine. Though it is difficult to truly measure the impact of a given shock, we can turn to polls to see how a shock can affect public opinion.</description>

      <description>This week, I examine whether or not there is a relationship between turnout and expert rating. To do so, I run two models: the first seeing if expert rating can predict turnout, and the second doing the same while controlling for incumbency.
## ## =========================================================== ## Dependent variable: ## --------------------------------------- ## turnout ## (1) (2) ## ----------------------------------------------------------- ## avg_rating -0.006 -0.012** ## (0.005) (0.006) ## ## RepStatusIncumbent 0.035* ## (0.021) ## ## Constant 0.</description>
