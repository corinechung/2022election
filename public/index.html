            This week, I explored the effect of political advertisements (from 2006 to 2018) on the Democrat voteshare at the Congressional district level. The specific relationship I will explore is the effect that Democratic advertisement share (the percentage of ads run in the district that were for the Democratic candidate) has on Democratic voteshare.
I ran a simple linear regression model between Democratic voteshare and Democratic ad share. The table below shows each district’s linear regression model and its r-squared value and coefficient for Democratic ad share.

        <p>
            Introduction In this week&rsquo;s blog, I present my final prediction model for the 2022 House Midterms. My final prediction model is a linear regression model using data from 1950-2020 to then predict the results in the House of Representatives for 2022. I predict that the Democrats will win 207 seats, while the Republicans will win 223 seats, resulting in a Republican victory in the House of Representatives.
Model Justification The main inspiration from my model came from the article “Will Democrats Catch a Wave?

            Michigan Michigan is known to be a battleground state, where races are highly contested. In 2016, Donald Trump secured Michigan with a narrow margin of approximately 0.3%; alternatively in 2020, Joe Biden won by approximately 2.8%, effectively flipping the state.
Examining Michigan on a more specific district-level, Michigan underwent redistricting district after the 2020 census. Elissa Slotkin was first elected to represent Michigan&rsquo;s 8th Congressional District in 2018, after defeating the incumbent, Mike Bishop (R), by a 3.

        <p>
            Shocks As discussed in class and section, election shocks are events that couldn&rsquo;t have been predicted but could significantly affect election outcomes. Examples of shocks from this year include the overturning of Roe v. Wade via the Dobbs decision and the war in Ukraine. Though it is difficult to truly measure the impact of a given shock, we can turn to polls to see how a shock can affect public opinion.

            This week, I examine whether or not there is a relationship between turnout and expert rating. To do so, I run two models: the first seeing if expert rating can predict turnout, and the second doing the same while controlling for incumbency.
## ## ============================================================= ## Dependent variable: ## ----------------------------------------- ## turnout ## (1) (2) ## ------------------------------------------------------------- ## avg_rating -0.001 -0.011* ## (0.005) (0.006) ## ## RepStatusIncumbent 0.059*** ## (0.022) ## ## Constant 0.
